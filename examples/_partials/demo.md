# Partials Demo Slide

**This entire slide is from a partial file!**

You can include complete slides from partials, making it easy to:

1. **Maintain consistency** across multiple presentations
2. **Update once, reflect everywhere** when content changes
3. **Share best practices** across your team
4. **Build presentation libraries** for different topics

**Tip:** Use `:Presenterm partial edit` when cursor is on an include directive to quickly edit the partial!
